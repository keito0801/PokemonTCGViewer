This site is an interatcive Pokemon TCG viewer. A simple search engine is offered allowing the user to search for any pokemon by name and see all available trading cards coresponding to that pokemon. A selection menu is also available to allow for a more focused search on a particualr series of pokemon cards.
This site was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After searching for a name the site will render a set of pokemon cards displaying its name, type, series,  and a small description.

Some ideas for future improvements could include making each card interative so that more inforamtion can be given. Making a functioning navbar so that the site can offer more than just the search feature can also be a nice improvment. Making the search bar more intutive so that it is faster and easier to use would be a great improvment in the future as well.
